          MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) is a benchmark
          designed to evaluate the performance of language models across
          a wide range of subjects. This dataset includes ~14,000
          multiple-choice questions covering 57 topic areas,
          with each question having four answer choices.
          The benchmark is used to assess the general knowledge and capabilities
          of AI models.
